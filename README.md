# detect-n-track
Implementation of methods to detect and track an object(face in our example) -
1. Mean Shift Algorithm ( fixed window size )
2. Cam Shift Algorithm ( variable window size )
3. Kalman Filter
4. Optical Flow

Initial face detection is done by Viola-Jones detection algorithm, using OpenCV Haar Front-Face detection filters.

Pre-Requisities -
OpenCV
Python
